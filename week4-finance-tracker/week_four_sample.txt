Week 4: File Handling and Final Project
--------------------------------------

This file is a sample text file created for Week 4.

In Week 4, I learned about:
- Reading from and writing to files
- Using text files and JSON files for data storage
- Working with CSV files
- Using the "with" statement for file handling
- Handling file errors using try and except
- Organizing code into multiple files and modules

Project Summary:
For Week 4, I created a Personal Finance Tracker using Python.

The program allows the user to:
- Add expenses with date, amount, and category
- Save expense data to a JSON file
- Load saved data when the program starts
- Generate simple reports
- Export data to a CSV file

This project helped me understand how file handling
can be used in real-life applications.

This text file is included as a sample to demonstrate
basic file handling concepts.
