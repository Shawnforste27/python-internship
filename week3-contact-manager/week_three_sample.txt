Week 3: Functions and Dictionaries
---------------------------------

This file is a sample text file created for Week 3 practice.

In Week 3, I learned about:
- Creating functions using the def keyword
- Passing parameters to functions
- Returning values from functions
- Using dictionaries to store data in key-value format
- Using string methods like lower(), upper(), strip(), and split()
- Understanding local and global variables

Project Summary:
I created a Contact Management System using Python.
The program allows the user to:
- Add new contacts
- Search contacts by name
- Update existing contacts
- Delete contacts
- View all saved contacts

Contacts are stored using dictionaries, where the contact name is the key
and phone number and email are stored as values.

This text file is used as a sample for understanding
basic file handling concepts.
